## 🔤 Core Concepts

The language is based on 19 capital letters, each representing a fundamental concept:

| Letter | Concept        | Level          | Key Aspects                  |
|--------|----------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| A      | Spirit         | Absolute       | divine → pure consciousness   |
| B      | Truth          | Absolute       | fact → absolute knowledge     |
| C      | Void           | Absolute       | silence → potential of being |
| D      | Light          | Transitional   | sun → enlightenment           |
| ...    | ...            | ...            | ...                          |

## ✨ Construction Principles

1. **Combinatorics**:  
   Each capital letter is specified by one of 10 lowercase letters (a-j).  
   → Example: `Ab` = "Holiness" (Spirit + modification b)

2. **Numerical system**:  
   The first 9 letters with apostrophes are used:  
   → `A'` = 1, `B'` = 2, ..., `I'` = 9, `—` = 0

3. **Syntax**:  
   Sentences are formed as chains of codes:  
   → `Bc Ja Rb` = "The seeker walks the mountain path"

### Philosophical Statements:
